# Chris Sprance
### Technical Artist/Web Developer/SysAdmin

My name is Chris Sprance. I am a technical artist, producer, and man of many
hats. Proficient in the next-gen game art workflow with a deep
understanding of the technical and procedural content pipeline including the constraints that revolve
around games and real-time content. With over 8+ years of experience working in the indie and AAA games industry I've been a part of a lot of problem solving and enjoyed every second of it! I am available for remote or on location employment/contract work.
